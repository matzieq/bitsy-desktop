# Bitsy desktop

A thin electron wrapper for bitsy. Use bitsy totally offline as a native desktop app!

## Where to get it?
Binaries are available in the releases section. They are pretty bloated, because electron. Currently Windows and Mac are supported, I will make a linux build soon-ish.

## How to build it yourself?
First you need to build the static documentation - go to `bitsy/docs`, then `npm i`, and `npm run build`.
Next - `npm i` in the main directory. Then `npm start` to run and test locally, `npm run make` to create a production build.

## Is if free?
Just like original bitsy, it's under MIT license. So download and hack away. Make it your own.
